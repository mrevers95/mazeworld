To run the code, please select the driver file for the component you want to test and run it. To animate a certain test, copy and past the JFrame code at the bottom of each driver class in front of the path you want to animate. Also, make sure the mazes are in the correct directory or the driver classes won't work. If you wish to change the starting or goal locations in the mazes, make sure you don't place any of the starting or end nodes on a wall or in other illegal locations!
